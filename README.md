# Supply Chain Analysis
In this project, we analyze a Supply Chain dataset sourced from Kaggle. We begin by importing the dataset from a CSV file into Power Query, where we meticulously clean and process the data. Once the data cleaning and processing are complete, we proceed with a thorough analysis, followed by the creation of dashboards to extract valuable insights. These dashboards provide a comprehensive view of the supply chain data, aiding in informed decision-making. Thank you for your attention.
